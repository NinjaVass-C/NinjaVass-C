My name is Connor, and I am a second year Computer Programming and Analysis student at St Lawrence College. I am still fairly new to the world of coding, so this account
will be used to learn and develop my skills, as well as work on projects I am passionate about. I have always had a passion for the field of technology, starting with 
video and photo editing, and continuing on to programming.

## Currently Working
My first passion project, the OWL Archive (https://github.com/NinjaVass-C/OWLArchive), has been something I have thought about ever since support for the Overwatch League website was taken down. Knowing 
more about web design and backend development, I have decided to take this challenge upon myself, creating something that not only helps me develop as a programmer, but is something I would actually use!
