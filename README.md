## Currently Working  
I am currently working on Distorted Realities (https://github.com/NinjaVass-C/distorted-realities), a SCP foundation inspired open-source story project where user add individual entries to a larger universe narrative. It involves full system design, authentication, and more, acting as a flagship project for personal experience and learning. 

BlackJack (https://github.com/NinjaVass-C/BlackjackJava), the casino game everyone has heard of at some point, is something I have been interested in making for a while now. From all the logic, moving variables, and potential features, I decided to go upon making a full-stack blackjack application in Java, with plans to make a Spring Boot API, front end, and have all the features of blackjack in one (side bets, counting cards, multi hand, etc.)
